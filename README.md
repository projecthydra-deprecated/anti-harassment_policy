Project Hydra Anti-Harassment Policy
====================================

[Project Hydra](http://projecthydra.org/) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone. Project Hydra was conceived and executed as a collaborative, open source effort from its very beginning, committed to openness and transparency in all that it does: code, designs, discussions.  We are equally committed to helpful and respectful communication.

Project Hydra has established the following policy & protocol to make it clear that we do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as IRC-based chatrooms or mailing lists.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to sex, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, religion; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants in Project Hydra communication channels violating the anti-harassment policy may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers of the meeting (if the channel is an in-person event) or the Project Hydra Steering Group (if the channel is online).

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers and Steering Group representatives (or their designees) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the meeting or other community channels, or contacting a higher authority such as a representative from the offender's institution.

We expect participants to follow the anti-harassment policy at all meeting venues, meeting-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value your participation in the Project Hydra community and your support in keeping the Hydra community a safe, welcoming, and friendly space for fellow participants!

## Protocol for Conflict Resolution

1. Report

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
    have any other concerns, please contact a local meeting organizer, the
    [Hydra community helpers](mailto:helpers@projecthydra.org), a community
    member you trust, or the
    [Project Hydra Steering Group](mailto:hydra-steering@googlegroups.com)
    immediately.

2. Escalate

    If you are at a meeting or other event, find an event organizer, a Hydra
    helper, or a representative of the Steering Group. He or she will assist
    you. Project Hydra meeting organizers can be identified by their name
    badges, and will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
    law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
    harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meeting/conference.

    If you are in the #projecthydra IRC channel, a bot named "zoia" can list
    people designated as channel helpers if you issue the `@helpers` command.
    Each person in that list has volunteered to help victims of harassment.
    You may also send email to the 	[Hydra community helpers](mailto:helpers@projecthydra.org) or the
    [Project Hydra Steering Group](mailto:hydra-steering@googlegroups.com); 	their names are available on the Hydra wiki.

    If you have been harassed over email, you may send email to the 	[Hydra community helpers](mailto:helpers@projecthydra.org) or the
    [Project Hydra Steering Group](mailto:hydra-steering@googlegroups.com); 	their names are available on the Hydra wiki.

3. Resolve

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support
    those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately (whatever
    individuals are comfortable with).

    Should an individual aiming to help a victim of harassment encounter
    issues following the anti-harassment policy and protocol, that individual should
    engage the community about these issues. Then, the community
    should revise the policy or protocol appropriately to ensure a safe and
    welcoming community in which harassment is not tolerated.
