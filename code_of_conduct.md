Project Hydra Code of Conduct
=============================

Project Hydra is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ~~body size~~, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel (such as IRC-based chatrooms or mailing lists). Participants at Project Hydra meetings or conferences violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, ~~body size~~, race, religion, sexual and or discriminatory images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the venue. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a local meeting organizer or the [Project Hydra steering group](mailto:hydra-steering@googlegroups.com) immediately.

Project Hydra meeting organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. If you are in the #projecthydra IRC channel, a bot named "zoia" can list people designated as channel helpers if you issue the `@helpers` command. Each person in that list has volunteered to help victims of harassment.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meeting venues, meeting-related social events, community gatherings, and online communication channels.

We value your participation in the Project Hydra community and your support in keeping the Hydra community a safe, welcoming, and friendly space for fellow participants!
